## Useful Resources
As you work through this course, there are quite a few resources that you should be aware of, and that will make you life much easier.

### React Resources
* [The Documentation for React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - an overview, and detailed information for all things React related.
* [React on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_react.asp) - a series of tutorials about react. This is often a great place to go for a quick reminder on a specific features.
* [The React.js cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/react) - This is a very short cheat sheet for specific React syntax
* [The React Lifecycle Methods Diagram](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) - React has its own lifecycle, and it's important to know it. This chart gives you a great way of figuring out what happens when.
* [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - we'll be using the react-router-dom component to make linking to various parts of our site easier. This is the documentation for it.
* [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/)

### Golang Resources
* I assume that you have a basic understanding of Go, but it never hurts to have access to some resources to look things up.
* [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) - this is a great place to go for a quick refresher on Go basics.
* [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) - a great overview of how to accomplish common tasks using the Go language.
